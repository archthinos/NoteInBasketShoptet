# Multi-Language Shopping Cart Note Plugin

## Overview

This JavaScript plugin enhances e-commerce shopping carts by enabling customers to add personalized notes to each product. These notes are then consolidated into one comprehensive note in the final order. Tailored for global e-commerce platforms, the plugin supports multiple languages and offers easy integration.

## Key Features

- **Individual Product Notes**: Adds a text area to each product in the shopping cart for custom notes.
- **Order Note Consolidation**: Compiles all product-specific notes into a single, comprehensive order note.
- **Multilingual Support**: Dynamically sets the language based on the domain, supporting Slovak (`.sk`), Czech (`.cz`), Hungarian (`.hu`), and English (default).
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed for easy addition to existing e-commerce platforms, with minimal setup required.

## Technical Details
